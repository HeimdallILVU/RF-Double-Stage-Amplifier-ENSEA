Automatically determined a snap distance of
0.053 um for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.001 um.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

The port setup needed to be corrected:
TML calibration for port "P13" has been changed
to TML (zero length) calibration because the
transmission line of pin "P13" would otherwise
intersect with the layout.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

The port setup needed to be corrected:
TML calibration for port "P7" has been changed
to TML (zero length) calibration because the
transmission line of pin "P7" would otherwise
intersect with the layout.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

The port setup needed to be corrected:
TML calibration for port "P8" has been changed
to TML (zero length) calibration because the
transmission line of pin "P8" would otherwise
intersect with the layout.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

The port setup needed to be corrected:
TML calibration for port "P11" has been changed
to TML (zero length) calibration because the
transmission line of pin "P11" would otherwise
intersect with the layout.

The port setup needed to be corrected:
TML calibration for port "P9" has been changed
to TML (zero length) calibration because the
transmission line of pin "P9" would otherwise
intersect with the layout.
