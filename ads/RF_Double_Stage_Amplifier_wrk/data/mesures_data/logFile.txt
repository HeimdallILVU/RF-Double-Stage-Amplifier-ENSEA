SP SP3[1] <RF_Double_Stage_Amplifier_lib:mesures:schematic>   freq=(10 MHz->9 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP3'.
    The global circuit temperature (25 C or 298.15 K) does not equal the
    IEEE standard noise temperature (16.85 C or 290 K) in the noise
    analysis `SP3'. As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio loss at the
    the circuit temperature and the noise figure, defined and calculated
    at the standard noise temperature, might not agree for a passive
    circuit. To eliminate this possible discrepancy, set the Temp parameter
    on the Options item to 16.85 C.

Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP3'.
    Data in the Touchstone file `C:/Users/jerem/Documents/git/RF-Double-Stage-Amplifier-ENSEA/mesures/PROJETCC10K.S2P'
    does not cover the requested value of `freq'.
    Therefore, the required data was obtained by extrapolation.
