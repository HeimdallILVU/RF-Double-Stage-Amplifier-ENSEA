Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP3'.
    Data in the Touchstone file `C:/users/jerem/documents/git/rf-double-stage-amplifier-ensea/ads/jti_caps_s_series/circuit/data/251R15S100_H-SER.s2p'
    does not cover the requested value of `freq'.
    Therefore, the required data was obtained by extrapolation.

Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP3'.
    COMPONENT `X4.em_data':
       Simulator uses frequency higher than frequency range for model. The S-parameters are extrapolated.

Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP3'.
    COMPONENT `X4.em_data':
       S-parameter passivity is enforced.
