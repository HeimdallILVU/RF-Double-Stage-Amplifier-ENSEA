# Frequency Downshifting Module Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a frequency downshifting module using off-the-shelf Surface-Mount Device (SMD) components. The module addresses a specific issue faced by Mr. Bares, who needs to shift the frequency emitted by his WiFi emitter from the busy 2.4GHz band to a lower 869MHz band. This module will be placed between the emitter and a modified 869MHz compatible antenna.

## Objectives
- **Frequency Downshifting:** Shift the frequency from 2.4GHz to 869MHz.
- **Range:** Achieve a minimum range of 40 meters.
- **Data Rate:** Support a data rate of at least 2 Mb/s.
- **Latency:** Add no more than 1ms to the usual latency of WiFi.
- **Footprint & Power Consumption:** Maintain a compact footprint and low power consumption.

## Project Details
- **Tool Used:** The project is developed using Advanced Design System (ADS).
- **Workspace Directory:** All ADS project files are located in `./ads/project_system_work`.
- **Reports:** Weekly reports from each team member can be found in the `./reports` directory.
- **Team Size:** The project is being developed by a team of 5 engineers.
- **Prototyping:** Prototypes will be manufactured and tested at ENSEA.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository using SSH:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:HeimdallILVU/system_project_ENSEA.git
cd system_project_ENSEA
```

## Contributing
1. **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
   
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature_branch
   ```

2. **Make Changes:** Make your changes and commit them with a meaningful message.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of the changes"
   ```

3. **Push Changes:** Push your changes to GitHub.

   ```bash
   git push origin feature_branch
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request:** Go to the repository on GitHub and create a pull request.

## File Naming Conventions
To avoid conflicts and ensure clarity, follow these naming conventions:
- Use descriptive and unique names for files and components.
- Avoid using special characters and spaces. Instead, use underscores (`_`) or hyphens (`-`).
- Follow a consistent naming pattern (e.g., `feature_component_name`).

## Contact
For any queries or issues, please contact the project lead or any of the team members.

We are excited to develop this module and look forward to delivering a solution that meets Mr. Bares' needs. Prototypes will be tested and validated at ENSEA to ensure they meet the required specifications.

Thank you for your interest in our project!
